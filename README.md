# Django Blog Application

This is a learning project built with Django, where I developed a simple blog application to practice key concepts.

## Key Features

- **Django Models**: Defined models with fields such as `title`, `content`, `created_at`, and `category`.
- **Migrations**: Generated and applied migrations to create the necessary database tables.
- **Data Management**: Created instances of the `Post` model and filtered posts by category both in the Django shell and within views.

## What I Learned

1. How to create a Django project and app.
2. How to define models and their fields in `models.py`.
3. How to run migrations to update the database schema.
4. How to query the database by creating instances and filtering data.

This project helped me understand the basics of building and interacting with a Django application.
