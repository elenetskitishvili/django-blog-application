# Django Blog Application

This project is a **learning exercise** to practice building web applications using Django. The application is a simple blog that allows the creation and display of blog posts. It helped me understand key concepts in Django such as models, views, templates, and the admin interface.

## What I Learned

- **Creating a Django Project**: I learned how to start a new Django project and create an application within it.
- **Defining Models**: I learned how to define models with fields like `CharField`, `TextField`and `DateTimeField`.
- **Using Django Admin**: I explored Django’s built-in admin interface to create, update, and manage blog posts.
- **Views and Templates**: I learned how to create views to handle requests and display blog posts using templates.
- **Querying the Database**: I practiced querying the database using Django ORM, including creating new instances of the `Post` model and filtering posts by category.
- **Working with Migrations**: I learned how to use Django's migration system to create and update database tables based on model changes.
